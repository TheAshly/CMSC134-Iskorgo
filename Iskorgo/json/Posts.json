            "Her most remarkable work happened in 1843, when she translated an article about Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine.  Together with her translation, she added her own detailed notes, including an algorithm for the Analytical machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This algorithm is considered as the first computer program.  Because of her brilliance, Babbage called her \"The Enchantress of Numbers\". ",
            "Well ahead of her time, she also foresaw countless potential uses of the machine that go beyond mathematical calculations. This laid the foundational groundwork for modern computing. Today, her legacy lives on in every algorithm, every device, and continues to inspire every woman in the tech industry.",

            "As The UP Intermedius celebrates its 33rd anniversary, the spotlight turns toward one of our own—a woman whose talent and artistry has leapt from university halls to lights, lenses, and center stage. Tara kept the passion for theater alive and even expanded to films long after stepping out of the university. Today, her star shines brighter than ever.",
